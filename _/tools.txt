Tools I use
- AssetStudio for extracting assets from unity games (look for forked versions that are more up to date)
- il2cppdumper for extracting dlls from unity games (necessary for some monobehaviors) and code symbols, to quickly determine things like numeric ids and enums
- Monkey Wrench from topper64.co.uk for various things relating to the BTD5 gen
- Ghidra, dnspy, and ida for various reverse engineering things
- JPEXS for extracting assets from flash games and looking at their code
- B1 Free Archiver for Battles 2 assets
- Tinke for DSiWare assets
- ShowMiiWADs for WiiWare assets
