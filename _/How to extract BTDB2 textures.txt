1) Download B1 Free Archiver (7zip doesn't work)
2) Open the jet file with the textures you want in B1 Free Archiver
3) Extract the textures using the password bJ2thyhRsN69jDD6
4) Change the extension of the texture from .png to .jpng and use Topper's Monkey Wrench app to convert it to a proper png


there's probably a way of automating this but I didn't feel like doing it
